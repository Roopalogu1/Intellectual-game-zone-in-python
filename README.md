# Intellectual-game-zone-in-python
ABOUT THE PROJECT:
TITLE: INTELLECTUAL GAME ZONE
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this Project is to include a list of games that develops probability skills and General knowledge. 
DESCRIPTION:
The “INTELLECTUAL GAME ZONE “script in Python was accomplished by using the core Python concepts like Conditional statements, Looping Statements, Control Statements, String manipulation Functions, Random modules, Math modules, Lists, tuples, defining a function, calling a function, match-case statement. The Game Zone includes a list of game-like programs that incorporates various core concepts in Python.
The list of games included in the game list is:
1.	GAME TITLE:” General Knowledge Quiz”: This part of the game includes two sub-divisions:1. Countries and Capitals, 2. India States and Capital.
CODING STYLE:  This General Knowledge quiz game was developed using the “Match-case statement” in Python. This match-case statement gets the choice of the user as input and matches with the list of cases that are predefined and validates the correct choice made.
GAME DESCRIPTION: Questions related to countries and their capital or India States, and capital are displayed. This GK quiz is so interesting and helps the user test their general knowledge
GAME RULES: A list of questions along with 3 options are displayed. The user has to input their answer. At the termination of the game, the score is displayed and also the user has to input if case if they want to continue to play other games available in the game zone.
SCORING: The player gets a “point” if the answer is correct and no negative score for the wrong answer
GAME FEATURE: It is a multiple-choice-based quiz.
FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: More questions and more subdivisions can be included in order to provide more choices to the player.
2.	GAME TITLE: ” SICBO” It is a rolling dice guessing game
CODING STYLE: randint() method is imported from the Random module which helps in fetching random numbers between a maximum and minimum value.
GAME DESCRIPTION: Sicbo is a popular casino game that involves guessing numbers between a predefined range. This game is all about probability where the player is in quest for his/her luck.
GAME RULES: The player has to guess 2 numbers, if guessed correctly the player wins the game.
SCORING: No scores are given when a player wins the chance.
GAME FEATURE: The upper limit and lower limit values are built-in, and the players cannot change this limit.
FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: Scores can be given for a specified number of chances.
3.	GAME TITLE:” Generating Number Sequence”: This is a number sequence generator that cannot be called a game exactly, but the player can have fun generating sequences between ranges while also exploring the magic in Mathematics.
CODING STYLE: Functions are declared with various number sequence names which are then called by getting the choice input from the player through the match-case statement. Each function makes use of Looping statements like “For loop”,” Nested For loop”, and “while loop” and conditional statements ( “IF else conditions”) are used to generate the number sequence.
GAME DESCRIPTION: This is a number sequence generator that generates sequences like Fibonacci generation, prime number generation, odd number generation, and even number generation.
GAME RULES: The player after inputting their choice of the number sequence is expected to input the start value and the end value.
SCORING: No scores are given
GAME FEATURE: This is a number sequence generator.
FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: More number sequence-generating functions can be included.
4.	GAME TITLE:” Pattern Printing”: Different patterns are printed as output. This again is not exactly a game, but it invokes the problem-solving skill and develops a rational perception. 
CODING STYLE: “Nested for Loops” are used repetitively to print the required pattern.
GAME DESCRIPTION: It is a pattern printing game that prints square, diamond, triangle, and Pascal triangle patterns.
GAME RULES: The player has to input the range and press enter to see the pattern getting printed.
SCORING: NO scores are given
GAME FEATURE:  It is a pattern printing game.
FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: More patterns can be included, for example, Heart pattern printing.
5.	GAME TITLE:” Science Quiz”: This is again a quiz game, but it exclusively includes science-related questions.
CODING STYLE: List () and Tuple() methods are used in this science quiz game. A list holding a tuple of questions is declared then a list holding a tuple of options is declared. For Loop is used to display the format “Question and then its relevant options”. 
GAME DESCRIPTION: This quiz is for all those science lovers who visit this “Intellectual Game Zone”.
GAME RULES: The player has to input their choice of answer after each question.
SCORING: 1 point for the correct answer
GAME FEATURE:  This is a science Quiz.
FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: A variety of science questions can be offered that are categorized age appropriately. 

WAYS TO “RUN” THIS PROGRAM:
1.	Command Line or Terminal:
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the .py file is located. Then, use the following command to run the script:
python INTELLECTUAL GAME ZONE.py
2.	Integrated Development Environment(IDE):
If the user is using an IDE like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or IDLE, you can open the .py file in the IDE and click on the “Run” or “debug” button to execute the script.
3.	Python Interactive Shell: You can open the Python interactive shell (Python REPL) by typing "python" or "python3" in the command prompt or terminal. Once the interactive shell is open, you can use the "exec" function to run the contents of the .py file. For example:
Exec(open(“INTELLECTUAL GAME ZONE.py”).read())
4.	Python Launcher (Windows): On Windows, if you have Python installed, you can use the Python Launcher to run .py files directly. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where the .py file is located. Then, use the following command to run the script:
Py INTELLECTUAL GAME ZONE.py
5.	Batch Files or Shell scripts:
If you want to automate the execution of a .py file, you can create a batch file on Windows or a shell script on Unix-like systems (e.g., a Bash script).
These files allow you to specify the command to run the .py file along with any desired options or arguments.

DEPENDENCIES:
This “INTELLECTUAL GAME ZONE” project was completely developed only using the core concepts in Python programming language. The entire program does not include any third-party libraries like ‘numpy’, ‘pandas’, ‘tensorflow’, or ‘matplotlib’ and so the user need not install any of the libraries to execute the program. Also, this particular script need not interact with any external program or tools through system commands or API i.e., this program is not dependent on any database systems, web servers, or command-line tools.
In short “INTELLECTUAL GAME ZONE” PROJECT is independent of all possible dependencies.
